		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2.2 Booking After Balance Due Date</p>

<p>Should you book a holiday after the balance due date has passed, the total holiday cost must be paid immediately at the time of booking.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2.3 Online Booking Confirmation</p>

<p>Making a payment online does not guarantee your booking. Your booking is considered confirmed only after we issue a final booking confirmation. We will refund the full amount paid if we cannot confirm your services due to lack of availability. Refunds may take up to two weeks to process, and we are not liable for any interest, surcharges, or fees you may incur due to the refund delay.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2.4 Room Allocation and Occupancy</p>

<p>The prices are based on two or three adults sharing a room, with a maximum occupancy of three adults, excluding infants. We reserve the right to allocate rooms differently, including the option to use split rooms. While we guarantee accommodation for three individuals, the exact bed configuration is not guaranteed for triple rooms. Note that triple rooms in the UK and Europe are often very small. Single travellers will incur a single traveller supplement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2.5 Early Bird Offer Exclusions and Modifications</p>

<p>Early Bird Offers do not apply to infants aged 0-23 months. The infant fare covers only a seat for coach holidays, without any additional amenities. Additionally, the Early Bird Offer will not be available for bookings opting for flight reductions and will be rescinded if any changes are made to a booking.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2.6 Balance Payment Responsibility and Visa Processing</p>

<p>You are responsible for remembering to pay the remaining balance by the due date, irrespective of visa processing status. Failure to do so will result in the cancellation of your booking and forfeiture of your deposit. Late payments will incur a fee of &pound;10 per person.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2.7 Promotional Offers</p>

<p>Early Bird and other web-only promotional discounts are valid only with confirmed bookings and the corresponding deposit payment. We reserve the right to withdraw these offers at any time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2.8 Invoice and Document Accuracy</p>

<p>You must review the confirmation invoice and other documents provided by Star Tours for accuracy. If you find any errors or inaccuracies, report them immediately to Star Tours or your travel agent, as corrections might not be possible later.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. YOUR HOLIDAY PRICE</strong></p>

<p>3.1 Pricing and Adjustments</p>

<p>Your holiday&rsquo;s cost is as indicated on our website or in your booking invoice, aside from potential errors. Although we hold the right to modify the prices at any moment, these alterations will not officially affect the bookings we have already acknowledged. However, after the confirmation of your booking, there might be a change in the holiday price due to fluctuations in:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(a) Transportation expenses, which encompass fuel price variations</p>

<p>(b) Government-imposed dues, taxes, or other fees like landing or port charges</p>

<p>(c) Current exchange rates affecting your holiday package</p>

<p>(d) A notable increase in any component of the tour, such as accommodation, entry fees, flights, or meals</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We maintain the right to correct any pricing errors on our platforms and reservations made at an incorrect price.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3.2 Significant Price Increases</p>

<p>If the holiday price increases by more than 10%, you have the option to cancel your booking and receive a full refund. To do this, you must notify us within seven days of receiving the notification of the price increase, and we will refund the total amount paid to us for your booking.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3.3 Applicability of Offers and Discounts</p>

<p>Early Bird offers and other discounts are valid when both the land arrangements and flight components of the tour align with the initially quoted tour price, without the addition of any surcharges for flights or hotels. These discounts are available for unmodified tours and can be withdrawn at any time without notice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3.4 Breakdown of Costs</p>

<p>We are not obligated to provide a detailed breakdown of the individual costs involved in your holiday package.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3.5 Refund Policy for Cancelled or Restricted Excursions</p>

<p>In cases where excursions are cancelled or restricted due to unforeseen circumstances including national or public holidays in the destination country, we will offer clients a refund equal to the difference between the ticket price and our contracted rate. Infants and children may sometimes be ineligible for this refund.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3.6 Dynamic Pricing Policy</p>

<p>Star Tours employs a dynamic pricing policy, meaning that tour prices may fluctuate due to various factors including service availability or the addition of new services. The price confirmed at the time of your booking is final; we cannot adjust it to match any previously seen prices. Please note that our website will always display the most current pricing, as brochures may be published several months in advance and may not reflect the latest updates.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>*Note: When downgrading a tour, the payment must be settled in full at the time of the alteration, treating it as a final modification. Downgrades are limited to a three-day tour option and are non-negotiable beyond this. This option is not extended to tours spanning three days or fewer, UK Tours, or services from our affiliate partners.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4.2 The cancellation policies for One Day tours managed by Star Tours Ltd align with those stated in Clause 5.1 pertaining to Coach Tours. Modifications to name or date can be availed up to 7 days before departure upon presenting a written notice; this will incur an administrative charge of &pound;15/$25 per person.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4.3 A cap of two amendments per booking has been established. The fee structure will be employed for each change, subject to approval. Regrettably, requests exceeding two alterations cannot be taken.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4.4 In the event you want to substitute a passenger post confirmation, Star Tours is not to find a substitute for the departing member.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4.5 Altering and then reverting to the initial booking will be perceived as change(s), for which no refunds, discounts, or compensations can be pursued.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4.6 All passengers in a booking, including those in conjunction with bookings, must adhere to the same pickup and drop-off locations. Changes to these locations can be requested up to 10 days before departure (21 days for bank and national holidays), subject to our approval. Note that changes within 10 days of departure may not be accommodated. If the change can be made, then a and a &pound;15 per person administrative fee will be applied. Pickup and drop-off locations will be confirmed 24 hours before departure based on availability.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4.7 For Flight Tours and FIT Tours, any amendments including name or date changes made more than 6 weeks prior to the departure date will incur a fee of &pound;100 per person. Within 6 weeks of the departure, no changes can be made. These amendments will also be governed by the cancellation policies stated in clause 5.1 of these guidelines. Please note that changes cannot be made to bookings where flight tickets have been issued for visa purposes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4.8 Please be advised that any alterations will nullify previously applied discounts, offers, or deals rendered at the initial booking stage. Note: Certain travel arrangements (such as Apex / No-frills airline tickets) may be immune to changes post-reservation, potentially triggering a cancellation charge of up to 100% for that segment or the entirety of the arrangements.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. IF YOU CANCEL YOUR HOLIDAY</strong></p>

<p>5.1 Notification of Cancellation</p>

<p>Should you or a party member decide to cancel the holiday, the primary contact must formally notify us or the travel agent where the booking was made, in writing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5.2 Cancellation Charges</p>

<p>Upon your notification of cancellation, we will apply the cancellation fees as stipulated in the table (to be provided). These fees are determined based on the timing of your written notification. This policy holds under various circumstances including but not limited to:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please note that the percentages in the cancellation charge table represent a portion of the total holiday price, excluding any insurance premium or additional charges; these may still require full payment (examples include but are not limited to visa charges, courier fees, and postal charges).</p>

<p>5.3 Re-booking following a cancellation.</p>

<p>If you choose to cancel a holiday and then re-book, the terms stipulated in the cancellation section of these booking conditions will be applied.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>6. BOOKINGS MADE ONLINE</strong></p>

<p>6.1 Provisional Bookings</p>

<p>Bookings initiated through our web portal are provisional until Star Tours officially confirms them through issuing a final confirmation invoice. Please note that a payment made at the booking time does not assure the booking confirmation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6.2 Booking Review and Accuracy Check</p>

<p>Star Tours reserves the right to review all online bookings for accuracy before confirming the requested services. If any part of your booking, including but not limited to room preferences, seating arrangements, or pick up point selection, violates our terms and conditions or published information, we may decline the booking. In such cases, we will contact you to address the discrepancies, allowing you to either modify your booking according to the prevailing policies and prices or cancel your provisional booking. Please note that the online booking system may sometimes allow selections that are subject to our approval and are contrary to our policies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6.3 Payment Details</p>

<p>All payments made via the online booking portal must be in UK Sterling. If you opt to pay with a non-UK bank debit/credit card or a FOREX/Pre-paid card, be aware that you will bear any surcharges/fees levied by your issuing bank or building society, in addition to a 2%. Transactions made with corporate cards will incur a 4% surcharge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6.4 Responsibility for Booking Details</p>

<p>You are responsible for verifying that all details are accurate before finalising your booking with a payment. Should any changes be necessary post-confirmation, they will be subject to the cancellation or change fees outlined in clauses 4 and 5 of these terms and conditions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>7. IF WE CHANGE YOUR HOLIDAY</strong></p>

<p>7.1 General Modifications</p>

<p>We reserve the right to make necessary alterations to your holiday arrangements at any time. Suppose we are unable to provide the booked travel arrangements or a similar alternative, in that case, you have the option to either receive a complete refund of all monies paid or accept an offer of alternative travel arrangements of a comparable standard, if available. In line with EU regulations, we are obliged to disclose the actual carrier orchestrating your flight/transfer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7.2 Minor Adjustments</p>

<p>Minor alterations to your holiday, such as adjustments to travel times, excursions, departure and return points, transportation mode to a significant joining point, short-term changes in accommodation standard, or non-significant itinerary amendments, will not entitle you to any compensation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7.2 (a) Dover pickups are conditional upon ferry services departing from the Dover Port and are not guaranteed. You may initially choose Dover; however, if unavailable, you will be required to modify your pickup location, with no liabilities falling on Star Tours for any associated costs. This will only be confirmed a few days prior to departure.</p>

<p>7.2 (b) Calais pickups are conditional upon ferry services arriving into the Port of Calais and are not guaranteed. You may initially choose Calais; however, if unavailable, you will be required to modify your pickup location, to Dunkirk, with no liabilities falling on Star Tours for any associated costs. This will only be confirmed a few days prior to departure.</p>

<p>7.2 (c) If utilising an external pickup service, transportation to the coach boarding point may be facilitated through a variety of vehicles including private cars or minibuses. Note that return services might have a waiting period up to 90 minutes for a connecting coach.</p>

<p>7.2 (d) We reserve the right to alter external pickup timings at our discretion. This will be notified to you within 24 hours of departure only.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7.3 Significant Alterations</p>

<p>In the event of substantial changes to your holiday, such as altering your UK airport (excluding transitions between recognized London airports) or modifying your departure/return time by over 12 hours, we will notify you promptly. Subsequently, you may either accept the modified holiday arrangement, choose a different holiday option (with a refund for any price difference), or cancel your booking.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7.4 Cancellation Following Major Changes</p>

<p>Suppose you choose to cancel your booking owing to a significant change. In that case, we will refund all amounts paid towards services exclusively offered by us, with no compensation covering other bookings or potential losses arising from the change.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7.5 Limitations on Compensation</p>

<p>We are not obliged to offer compensation for either minor or substantial changes, including, but not limited to:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7.5 (a) The cancellation of tours resulting in additional costs for services booked separately.</p>

<p>7.5 (b) Events unforeseen or beyond our control, encompassing natural disasters, political unrest, or transportation disruptions, which could not be averted despite exercising all necessary precautions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7.6 Excursion Cancellations</p>

<p>In circumstances characterised by unusual or unforeseeable conditions, including national or public holidays in the visited country necessitating the cancellation/restriction of an excursion, we will provide reimbursement options at our contracted rate only. These options may vary depending on individual circumstances and may not extend to infants and children.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7.7 Events and Festivals</p>

<p>Due to occurrences such as trade fairs, exhibitions, and national holidays, there might be a necessity to alter the designated hotels and locations. Despite our efforts to avoid these situations, any changes necessitated by such events will not be valid grounds for grievances either during or after the tour.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7.8 Changes During the 2024 Paris Olympics</p>

<p>During the 2024 Paris Olympics, we anticipate that there may be substantial and sudden alterations to the itinerary without advance notice. Sightseeing experiences may be impacted; specific landmarks might be inaccessible due to events taking place, necessitating replacements that may not be communicated in advance. The routing of tours within Paris will comply with local restrictions in place at that time. Please be advised that delays encountered, or sights missed owing to traffic disruptions or road closures will not be eligible for reimbursement during the Olympics period in Paris. It is encouraged to remain flexible with the tour arrangements during this globally recognised event to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>12.2 Star Tours&rsquo; liability arising from this contract regarding your holiday, tour, or excursion, will not exceed the total amount paid or agreed to be paid for the holiday, and will not include any consequential loss or additional expenses in any case.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>12. You are responsible for checking in for flights and coaches and presenting yourself at pre-booked attractions at the specified times while on holiday. Star Tours will not be liable for any missed flights due to late check-ins or late arrivals, and no credit or refunds will be issued for failing to utilise any component of your tour.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>12.4 The hotels utilised may not feature amenities such as air-conditioning, fans, kettles, and other services you may be accustomed to. While efforts are made to contract hotels offering these amenities, there is no guarantee. In the event of non-functioning or unavailable amenities, no compensation will be provided.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>13. COMPLAINTS</strong></p>

<p>13.1 Should you encounter any issues or have complaints during your holiday, promptly notify the relevant supplier (e.g., hotel owner) and our tour representative to facilitate immediate resolution. If unresolved, lodge a formal complaint within 28 days of your holiday&rsquo;s conclusion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>13.2 For complaints involving the negligence of our suppliers, subcontractors, or agents, and not Star Tours or its employees, no liability will be assumed if the issue is not reported immediately during the tour, following the above procedure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>13.3 We aim to address complaints within 28 days; however, responses might be delayed due to investigations and waiting for feedback from suppliers or third parties. Disputes or claims arising from your contract or holiday must adhere to the ABTA arbitration scheme or be taken to the courts of England and Wales, which hold exclusive jurisdiction. For further details on the arbitration scheme, visit the ABTA website at www.abta.com.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>13.4 Failing to adhere to this complaint procedure diminishes our ability to investigate and address your concerns while on the tour, thereby affecting your rights under this contract.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>14. PASSPORTS &amp; VISAS</strong></p>

<p>14.1 General Provisions</p>

<p>(a) Application</p>

<p>The passengers are responsible for allocating sufficient time for passport applications based on the guidelines provided by relevant embassies. Star Tours may impose additional charges for visa services beyond the standard fees during peak periods.</p>

<p>(b) Travel Documents</p>

<p>Passengers must ensure they secure all requisite travel documents before the start of the tour. Those processing visas with Star Tours should note that visa acquisition cannot be guaranteed, as the embassies hold the final authority. If a passenger fails to secure necessary travel documents after confirming the tour, the cancellation policy outlined in these terms and conditions will apply.</p>

<p>(c) Visa service provision</p>

<p>The visa assistance service is available at an extra fee, separate from the holiday package cost. Passengers must provide all documents in one go; incomplete submissions will not be accepted. Star Tours determines the visa application submission date and is not liable for consulate decisions or any loss/damage of documents during the process. Visa approvals are at the consulate&#39;s discretion. Ensuring the correct visa before travel is the passenger&rsquo;s responsibility. Failure to do so activates the cancellation policy noted in clause 5.1. Star Tours bears no responsibility for loss or damage to documents and passports during embassy procedures.</p>

<p>(d) In instances where Star Tours UK is managing your visa process and it is rejected, refused, or delayed by the consulate, cancellation charges will apply based on when the update is received prior to departure: an update received more than 10 days before departure will incur a 25% charge for coach tours and a 40% charge for flight &amp; FIT tours; updates received within 10 days of departure will incur a 35% charge for coach tours and a 50% charge for flight &amp; FIT tours. All visa fees and service charges are non-refundable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>14.2 Travel Disruptions</p>

<p>(a) Loss or Damage: Star Tours bears no responsibility for loss or damage to documents and passports during embassy procedures.</p>

<p>(b) Customs and Immigration: In case a passenger is detained or held back by governmental agencies, check in staff, or immigration officers in the destination country, or prior to boarding Star Tours will not bear any liability.&nbsp; Affected passengers must arrange their onward journey independently.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>14.3 Documentation Check</p>

<p>(a) Travel Document Verification: Passengers must scrutinise all travel documents issued in conjunction with the booking as soon as they receive them. Inconsistencies should be reported within 24 hours of receipt to avoid responsibility for associated amendment costs.</p>

<p>(b) Additional documentation requests.</p>

<p>If passengers are handling visa procedures independently, they must inform Star Tours in advance regarding any extra documentation required, such as hotel confirmation on a letterhead. Allow a preparation period of 7 to 10 working days for issuing such documents.</p>

<p>(c) Additional Passport Information (API): Certain airlines mandate API, and failure to provide this might result in denied boarding with no compensation or refund available from Star Tours.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>15. HEALTH</strong></p>

<p>15.1 Travel Insurance</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that all passengers have health and travel insurance from local providers before embarking on the journey.</p>

<p>15.2 Vaccinations and Health</p>

<p>(a) Check your countries Department of Travel &amp; Health website for destination-specific vaccination requirements. Maintain records of medical conditions and medications. Adhere to COVID-19 vaccination/testing guidelines.</p>

<p>(b) Allergies and Dietary Restrictions: Individuals with severe allergies should take necessary precautions before the trip, as we cannot guarantee allergen-free environments.</p>

<p>Star Tours cannot be held accountable for actions of other passengers that may trigger someone&#39;s allergies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>16. DAMAGE OR LOSS OF PROPERTY</strong></p>

<p>16.1 Liability</p>

<p>You shall bear the costs for any damage or loss caused by you or your party during the tour, failing which you will be liable for any resultant claims or legal actions.</p>

<p>16.2 Lost Property Star Tours is not responsible for recovering lost property due to safety and legal considerations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>17. HOLIDAY INSURANCE</strong></p>

<p>We insist that all travellers secure travel insurance before the journey, preferably at the time of booking your holiday, to initiate immediate coverage.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>18. FINANCIAL PROTECTION &amp; LICENSING</strong></p>
